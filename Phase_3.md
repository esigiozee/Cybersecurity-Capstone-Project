In phase 1, the goal was to build as robust a profile on the target, Artemis as possible. The deliverable covered 15 tools and methods that would be used to accomplish this task of reconnaissance. For phase 2, the goal was to identify at least 5 tools and techniques to be used to perform host discovery and enumeration. For phase 3, the goal is to now Identify the tools and techniques to be used to scan for vulnerabilities. Listed below will be the tools that will be used to perform vulnerabilities, how they will be used and screenshots of the tools showing configuration options and settings



* Tenable Nessus

* OpenVAS
    * is a free and open-source vulnerability scanner made to find possible security holes in various network services. It uses a database of known vulnerabilities to provide detailed information about misconfigurations, outdated software, and exploitable flaws.
    * How they get used:
        * **Setup & Configuration:** Set up OpenVAS with updated vulnerability databases. Configure scanning tasks based on network segments.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Perform a comprehensive scan to detect known vulnerabilities across network systems, focusing on outdated services and misconfigurations.
        * **Reporting:** Analyze scan results through detailed reports that categorize and prioritize vulnerabilities.
    * Pros
        * Free and open-source.
        * Regularly updated database of Network Vulnerability Tests.
        * Extensive configuration options.
    * Cons
        * Requires more setup and maintenance than some commercial tools.
        * User interface is less intuitive than Nessus.

* Burp Suite
    * Burp Suite is a well-known web application security testing tool that offers a complete solution for mapping, scanning, and exploiting web applications.
    * Usages:
        * **Configuration:** Configure Burp to intercept traffic from web applications deployed by Artemis.
        * **Automated Scanning**: Use the scanner module to automatically detect and report on vulnerabilities.
        * **Manual Testing:** Utilize the proxy tool to perform manual exploitation of vulnerabilities like SQL injections or XSS.
    * Pros
        * Comprehensive web application testing tool.
        * Supports both automated and manual testing methods.
    * Cons
        * Steep learning curve for new users.
        * Primarily focused on web applications, not network-level vulnerabilities.
