<h1> Invisible Threats: Comprehensive Cybersecurity Analysis of Artemis Gas, Inc </h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a 5 phases of a structured walkthrough penetration test of a fictional company, Artemis, Incorporated. In Phase 1, the objective was to perform reconnaissance of the client and the perimeter network. In Phase 2, the objective was to identify targets and run scans. In Phase 3, the objective was to identify vulnerabilities based on the information gathered in Phase 2. In Phase 4, the objective was to conduct a threat assessment by ranking the vulnerabilities based on likelihood and impact. In the last phase, the objective was to create and deliver two mock reports. The first report is a detailed technical report for IT staff, detailing what was “discovered,” including a list of vulnerabilities, an analysis of the findings, and remediation recommendations. The second is an executive summary, a document hypothetically intended for sharing with management.
